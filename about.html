      <p>My favorite animal is the cat. They are so cute. Cats have sharp eyes, sensitive ears, and soft fur, which makes them
         look cute. They love to play with balls of yarn and can sleep for many hours. Cats eat both meat and plant-based
         food. My favorite thing about cats is their playful jumps and gentle purring when happy.</p>
